For a photocopy store called PhotoShop, you have to make an application that can select different items from the store catalog and add this to a shopping cart. After the user has selected all the different items an invoice has to be created.

# Before you start coding
Every time you start coding you need to have a general idea of what to make, try to think about how to make the program before programming. Either write this out or make a UML (flow chart).

# Requirements

* The user needs to input either the id or name of the item to put it in the order.
* The user needs to be able to add multiple items to the order.
* The user needs to be able to create an invoice.
* On the invoice, the total cost of the entire order needs to be shown.
* On the invoice, the completion time needs to be shown.
* The date and time of pickup need to be within the opening hours of the store.
* The shopping cart needs to be saved to either XML or Json.
* Use the CSV files for the opening hours and the price list.
* The program needs to be made completely in the command log.


# Considerations

* Make sure you put sufficient comments in your code. 
* Apply inheritance, for example, order can inherit from photo. 
* Use the naming conventions correctly and consistently. 
* Make sure your code is efficient, readable, and maintainable. 
* The application should be easy to use.
